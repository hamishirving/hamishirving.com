          <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
          <p>Healthcare is most certainly broken. In this technological age, patient records are still mostly paper based and difficult to share, patient data still widely belongs in the hands of large medical institutions rather than the patients themselves and in many countries (particularly in the US) healthcare is becoming more and more inaccessible to those outside of corporate sponsored health plans and private insurance policies.</p>
          <p>The industry is not only ripe for, but in desperate need of disruption and one company that looks to shake things up in the space is a startup based out of California called <a class="link-body highlight highlight-small" href="http://www.jiohealth.com" target="_black">Jio Health.</a></p>
          <p>Their founder and CEO approached me early 2013 with a vision to allow people to take back control of their health and I was immediately interested.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Stunted growth</h1>
          <p>Jio has evolved several times over the past three years. Initially they were heavily tied to large Care Provider Networks, building technology solutions which allowed them to connect their physicians directly to their patient populations in order to better manage various chronic diseases.
          <p>We worked with a large Care Provider in california to develop a physician dashboard that would present information submitted by patients in real-time.</p>
          <p>It allowed physicians to track patients vital information remotely and would present alerts to physicians if vitals readings fell outside of a healthy range, this would prompt the physician to reach out to the patient and prevent any further worsening of their condition.</p>

          <p>However large institutions move slowly and Jio soon realised that in order to fulfil its vision to reach more people, it would have to break free of any established organisations and go it alone.</p>

          <p>In order to encourage the virality of the app and so that users could share their progress with family members and others close to them, we introduced a feature called Halo. This provided two benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It provided a form of accountability by allowing you to share your progress with family and friends.</li>
            <li>It gave less able users the ability to nominate someone to act in a caregiver role and use the app on their behalf.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Halo became a network of people close to you who share in your progress and encourage you to reach your goals for better health.</p>
