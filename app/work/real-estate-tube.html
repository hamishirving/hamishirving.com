          <p><a class="link-body highlight highlight-small" href="http://www.realestatetube.com" target="_blank">Real Estate Tube</a> is a service that makes it really easy to create engaging videos to advertise your property for sale or to find new housemates. I was contacted by Steven the Co-Founder after being recommended by some developers who I had worked with in the past.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">The Problem</h1>
          <p>RET already had an app in the app store but it was in need of a little design love. Having downloaded the app and played with its functionally I identified the following areas for improvement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The brand colour was overused </li>
            <li>There was no clear hierarchy of content</li>
            <li>The navigation was confusing with no distinction between primary and secondary calls to action</li>
            <li>There were missed opportunities to use empty states to present useful information to the user</li>
            <li>Some of the icons were ambiguous and left me guessing at their functionality</li>
            <li>Creating a listing was daunting as it presented long screens with many form fields to complete</li>
            <li>Creating a video was confusing with ambiguous buttons and labels</li>
          </ul>
          <h1 class="heading">Research</h1>
          <p>Creating and editing a video is a complicated task made even more challenging by the limited screen space available on a mobile phone. It was imperative that this process was stripped down to the core features and allowed a user to get an engaging video online quickly.</p>
          <p>The first step was to research the raft of existing apps on the app store which provided video creation capabilities. Some of the more well known apps included YouTube, Vimeo, even iMovie on iOS along with some lesser known ones. All took a slightly different approach to the task.</p>
          <p>It was important to identify the best parts from each and combine them into a more coherent experience that allowed the user to create a video that really helped showcase their property and their personality.</p>

              <p>The next step was to dive into my sketch book and start playing around with some ideas. Sketching is a very low-cost way to try many different solutions to see which one might work.</p> 
              <p>For me this process is very messy but it allows me to get thoughts out of my head and onto paper and to start piecing together the various elements which make up the functionality.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Design</h1>
          <p>The brand color was very strong so I wanted to use it sparingly to call out important features and the primary call to actions. The rest of the interface needed to get out of the way and allow the content of the listings, especially the videos, to really stand out.</p>
          <p>Where there were previously tabs at the bottom of the screen to switch between Residential, Business & Commercial properties for sale, I instead added a filter option to the home screen and displayed all listings in one feed. This would ensure that first time users would always see some content on the screen.</p>

          <p>I wanted to create a different look & feel for the video creation screens. Rather than the light aesthetic, I went for a dark design similar to what you might experience if you were in a darkroom developing film. It helped to create a clear distinction between the content creation experience and the content consumption screens.</p>
          <p>The new design allowed the user to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add/edit each segment which makes up a video</li>
            <li>Rearrange segments within the video to change the order of when they are played</li>
            <li>Have a simplified view of the content of each sgement by seeing the tumbnail still</li>
            <li>Trim segments, add overlay text and define the transitions between segments</li>
            <li>Quickly preview the whole video so the user can see how it all comes together</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The edit segment screen also allowed for additional features to be added in the future such as the ability to add fun effects and personalise the video even further.</p>

          <p>With the new app designs complete and in development, the focus shifted to a web landing page that would help to explain the benefits of the app and showcase its features.</p>
          <p>I wanted the language of the page to reflect the dual benefits of the app. Not only could you create high quality videos to show off your property, but it also gave you an opportunity to express your personality which is important when looking for someone to share your home.</p>
