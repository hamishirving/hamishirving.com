          <ul>
            <li>I believe in the intersection of user needs and business case. Good design not only solves a users problem, it creates a sustainable business as well.</li>
            <li>I belive in constant iteration and that design is never finished.</li>
            <li>I believe in making educated assumptions, arriving at the quickest way to test that assumption and validating the idea through talking to real users.</li>
            <li>I beleive that design is a continual learning process. Learning about the problems users face in a given context, learning new techniques, learning new tools, always learning.</li>

              <p>In between Skype meetings and chat threads, working from home can sometimes get a little lonely. Thankfully I have a a trusty work colleague in Clover, our Miniature Schnauzer.</p>
              <p>Clover is great at making sure I don't work too hard by getting me out of my chair - as long as it results in food or walkies. This is Clover on her 2nd birthday. She got a cake with dog treats. A little bit ridiculous I know...</p>
