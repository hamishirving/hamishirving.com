          <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
          <p>I was recommended to Dan the CTO of <a class="link-body highlight highlight-small" href="http://www.medopad.com" target="_blank">Medopad</a> by a developer I had worked with on a previous project.</p>
          <p>Medopad are doing some really interesting things in healthcare by connecting hospitals and doctors directly to patients through the use of mobile technology.</p>
          <p>The company has always been quick to adopt new technology and my brief was to create an Apple Watch app to coincide with the first release of the Apple Watch in June 2015.</p>
          <h1 class="heading">The Problem</h1>
          <p>The ability to effectively manage cancer treatment relies heavily on strict drug regimens. These drugs can often cause adverse side-effects which result in the patient not adhering to their schedules and missing much needed medication.</p>
          <p>For patients, communicating these side-effects to doctors is a pain and unless a patient has a direct line of communication to their physician, the lapses in drug adherence can go unnoticed until the next hospital visit.</p>
          <h1 class="heading">Research</h1>
          <p>I use both iOS and Android devices in the my day to day and I rely on that familarity to make sure I am up to date with the current design patterns, navigation structures and interactions of each patform.</p>
          <p>Apple Watch was a completely new device, introducing new ways to interact along with new opportunites to capture information from the user. It was also pre-release so there was no way to get my hands on a device to get familiar with it.</p>
          <div class="img-push">
            <div class="img-push-copy">
              <p>A quick visit to the Apple website to read through the Apple Watch documentation allowed me to learn about the new gestures and the digital crown.</p>
              <p>I learned about the different ways to access app content through notifications, glances and the watch apps themselves.</p>
            </div>

            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Having becoming familar with the documentation I worked with Medopad alongside their Medical Advisors to define the scope of the first version of the app. It would allow patients to do four things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Receive real-time alerts to remind patients which medication to take at what time and at what dosage.</li>
            <li>Mark a medication as taken so their adherence can be measured and reported back to physicians.</li>
            <li>Report any symptoms they experience after taking their medication.</li>
            <li>Track their temperature throughout the day and report it back to their physician.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="body-copy">
          <h1 class="heading">Notifications</h1>
          <p>Notifications are a powerful feature on the Apple Watch. They allow information to be presented to the user right where they need it.</p>
          <p>The user initially receives a vibration to alert them they have received a notification. They can then decide if they want to act on it by raising their wrist to view the Short Look which tells the user what the notification is about and which app it is from.</p>
          <p>If they decide they want to know more, the user can keep their wrist raised and the notification turns into a Long Look which presents further information and allows them to interact with the notification for example by marking a medication as taken.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Reporting symptoms</h1>
          <p>The ability to report any symptoms experienced after taking medication is an important feature of the app. The design allowed for consumers to select from a list of potential symptoms and submit them to their doctor.</p>
          <p>I conceived a design that allowed for three different states:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial state which allowed the user to select the symptom.</li>
            <li>Selected state which asked the user to confirm and submit to their doctor.</li>
            <li>Confirmed state which showed the user that they had already selected that symptom.</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="body-copy">
          <h1 class="heading">The results</h1>
          <p>The app launch received some very positive feedback from both patients and doctors. The product continues to be developed and now has an companion iPhone app that mirrors a lot of the Watch apps' functionality.</p>
          <p>This initial engagement led to an offer to go full-time with Medopad in a Product Management & Design role which I respectfully declined.</p>
